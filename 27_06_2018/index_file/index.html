			<h1>Rosie Assoulin</h1>
			</section>&nbsp;

			<section class="a1">Rosie Assoulin grew up in Brooklyn and always knew that fashion was her one true love. She dedicated her time to honing her skills, initially under the tutelage of her mentor and future mother in law, the veteran jewelry designer, Roxanne Assoulin, at Lee Angel. After a brief stint at the Fashion Institute of Technology, she found herself at Oscar de la Renta in New York City, watching the always elegant Mr. de la Renta drape, cut and pin his legendary designs. Later, Rosie sought out a life altering opportunity to spend time with the design studio Lanvin in Paris, where she bore witness to Alber Elbazâ€™s pure, unbridled creativity and unmatched design talent.<br/> Along with a few years in event and floral design, she found that every moment is an opportunity to cultivate her perspective. In late 2012, Rosie decisively turned back towards her first love, fashion, and her eponymous collection made its debut for Resort 2014. The Rosie Assoulin design aesthetic toes the line between the romantically fantastical and the reliably practical.
